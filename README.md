# Hardhat Hackathon Boilerplate

This repository contains a sample project that you can use as the starting point
for your Ethereum project. It's also a great fit for learning the basics of
smart contract development.

This project is intended to be used with the
[Hardhat Beginners Tutorial](https://hardhat.org/tutorial), but you should be
able to follow it by yourself by reading the README and exploring its
`contracts`, `tests`, `scripts` and `frontend` directories.

## Quick start

The first things you need to do are cloning this repository and installing its
dependencies:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/samuveth/hardhat-hackathon-boilerplate-vue.git
cd hardhat-hackathon-boilerplate-vue
yarn install
```

Once installed, let's run Hardhat's testing network:

```sh
yarn hardhat node
```

Then, on a new terminal, go to the repository's root folder and run this to
deploy your contract:

```sh
yarn hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
```

Finally, we can run the frontend with:

```sh
cd frontend
yarn install
yarn serve
```

Open [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) to see your Dapp. You will
need to have [Metamask](https://metamask.io) installed and listening to
`localhost 8545`.

## User Guide

You can find detailed instructions on using this repository and many tips in [its documentation](https://hardhat.org/tutorial).

For a complete introduction to Hardhat, refer to [this guide](https://hardhat.org/getting-started/#overview).

## What’s Included?

Your environment will have everything you need to build a Dapp powered by Hardhat and Vue.

- [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/): An Ethereum development task runner and testing network.
- [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/): A JavaScript test runner.
- [Chai](https://www.chaijs.com/): A JavaScript assertion library.
- [ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.io/ethers.js/html/): A JavaScript library for interacting with Ethereum.
- [Waffle](https://github.com/EthWorks/Waffle/): To have Ethereum-specific Chai assertions/mathers.
- [A sample frontend/Dapp](./frontend): A Dapp which uses [Vue CLI (vue create)](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli).

## Troubleshooting

- `Invalid nonce` errors: if you are seeing this error on the `yarn hardhat node`
  console, try resetting your Metamask account. This will reset the account's
  transaction history and also the nonce. Open Metamask, click on your account
  followed by `Settings > Advanced > Reset Account`. Or you can also enable "Customize transaction nonce" in advanced settings, then you can enter the expected nounce from the error message.
